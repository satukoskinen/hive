#02: Ethernet interface characteristics: broadcast address and IP addresses that are part of the same subnet
ifconfig en0
#Broadcast address is an IP address where the host portion bits are set to one:
#it is used to broadcast a message to every host on a network.
#IP addresses (unique 32 bit number for a host on a TCP/IP network or the Internet)
#consist of two parts: network address which the routers use to deliver
#packets to the host's network, and host address which identifies the host
#within that network. Separating network and host portions of the IP address
#requires use of the subnet mask: bits set to 1 in the subnet mask determine
#the part of the IP address that specifies the network address, and the remaining
#bits set to zero specify the host address.
