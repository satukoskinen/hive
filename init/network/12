#12: IP that was assigned by the dhcp server
ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep 'yiaddr'
#Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automates the management and configuration of IP
#addresses across a network so that they don't need to be manually assigned each time
#a device connects. DHCP also configures the domain server, subnet masks and default gateways.
#ipconfig getpacket interface determines e.g. the IP address of the DHCP server from which the IP
#address, subnet mask etc of the given interface (e.g. en0, en1) is received.
