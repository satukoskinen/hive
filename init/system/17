#17: Connect via SSH on the VM
ssh -X username@address
#alternatively 'ssh -X -l username address'
#-X option enables X11 forwarding. On the client side, it can be made default with 'ForwardX11 yes' in ~/.ssh/config.
#On the server side, X11 forwarding must be allowed (as default not) by setting 'X11Forwarding yes' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
#Also, the xauth program must be installed on the server side.
#How ssh -X works: the program is run on the remote machine and a proxy X11 server is set up to which the running
#program sends the drawing programs. These are then forwarded by the proxy X11 server to the real X11 server on
#the local machine, which then draws on the screen.
