#22: Add a new local user
adduser user_name
#Alternatively, useradd
#adduser command is located in /usr/bin which needed to be added to the $PATH
#variable by adding export PATH="$PATH:/usr/sbin/" to ~/.bashrc.
#In general, if a certain command is not found, its location can be found by 'which command'.
#Then, one can check whether $PATH contains it.
